In this project, I undertook the exciting challenge of creating a comprehensive restaurant reservation platform that seamlessly facilitates online table bookings and secure payments. Leveraging my expertise in cutting-edge web development technologies, I utilized React.js along with Material-UI for building an engaging and user-friendly front-end interface. This allowed customers to easily search for available tables, specify their reservation preferences, and seamlessly proceed to the payment process.

On the back-end, I harnessed the power of Node.js and Express.js to create a robust API infrastructure. This enabled smooth communication between the front-end and the MongoDB database, where I carefully designed schemas to efficiently store user data, reservation details, and payment information. Through Mongoose, I ensured seamless interactions with the database, maintaining data integrity and enforcing validation checks to ensure accurate inputs.
